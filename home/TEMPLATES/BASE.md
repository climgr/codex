# {PROJECT_NAME} Specification

**Name**: {project_name}

**About this file:** `BASE.md` is the generic fallback template. When applied to a project, this file is copied into the project as `AI.md`. Throughout this document, all references to `AI.md` refer to that resulting file in a real project. Replace this with a language-specific template from the codexmgr template repos (e.g. `~/Projects/github/codexmgr/go/SERVER.md`) once the project's language and shape are known.

**Note:** `{PROJECT_NAME}` and `{project_name}` in this file are reference tokens, not setup-time text replacements. Their values are resolved from `IDEA.md ## Project variables` while `AI.md` remains read-only.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

**See `IDEA.md` for project-specific details.**

---

# SOURCE OF TRUTH AND IDEA.md PRECEDENCE

**See `IDEA.md` for features, data models, and business rules.**

IDEA.md is the project PLAN. AI.md (this file) is the SOURCE OF TRUTH.

| File | Role | Update When |
|------|------|-------------|
| **AI.md** | SOURCE OF TRUTH — implementation rules | Optional→required policy changes only |
| **IDEA.md** | PROJECT PLAN — must follow AI.md | Features change, project variables change |

**Rule:** If IDEA.md conflicts with AI.md, AI.md wins. Fix IDEA.md.

## IDEA.md Required Layout

**Every IDEA.md MUST have exactly these three top-level sections, in this order:**

```markdown
## Project description

(Full project description — what the project is, who uses it, what problem it solves.)

## Project variables

(All project variables in `key: value` form. Required keys at minimum: `project_name`,
`project_org`, `internal_name`, `internal_org`. Add more as the project needs — `app_name`,
`official_site`, `maintainer_name`, `maintainer_email`, `module_path`, `language`, etc.)

Example:

    project_name:  mytool
    project_org:   casjay
    # FROZEN — set once at first-time setup, never edit
    internal_name: mytool
    # FROZEN — set once at first-time setup, never edit
    internal_org:  casjay
    # primary implementation language
    language:      go
    official_site: https://mytool.example.com

## Business logic

(Full business spec — the WHAT, not the HOW. Features, data models, user flows,
permission rules, business invariants, platform targets, input modes, accessibility,
security assumptions, and any exceptions.)
```

**Rules for `## Project variables`:**
- One variable per line: `key: value`
- Keys are **lower_snake_case** only
- Never guess values: use commands and existing files
- If a placeholder referenced by AI.md has no entry in `## Project variables`, setup MUST stop and ask instead of inventing a value
- `internal_name` and `internal_org` are frozen forever once set — warn the user loudly when setting them for the first time

**Rules for `## Business logic`:**
- It MUST define the actual product scope for THIS project — not generic boilerplate
- It MUST state which surfaces exist: GUI, TUI, CLI, server, library, or a subset
- It MUST define user flows, stored data, trust boundaries, abuse cases, and platform constraints
- Language-specific exceptions and deviations from AI.md rules MUST be documented here

---

# PART 0: CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

## THIS IS A STRICT SPECIFICATION — NOT GUIDELINES

- Every item in this specification MUST be followed exactly unless explicitly marked optional
- This is not a suggestion document
- There are no silent exceptions
- If the spec says X, do X — not "improved X"
- If something seems wrong, follow it and flag it; do not silently rewrite intent

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: File Paths and Project Root

- All paths are relative to the project root unless explicitly noted
- Do not scatter top-level files unnecessarily
- Runtime-generated files are not committed
- AI must not move the project root or invent sibling repositories
- **Never edit files outside the project root to work around a problem inside it** — no host system files (`/etc/*`, shell rc files, systemd units), no sibling/other repositories, no global tool configs. A failing build, missing dependency, or broken tool inside the project is fixed in the project's own code/config/Docker image, never by reaching outside it. The only exception is an external path the user explicitly names for that specific task

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI.md is the Source of Truth

- `AI.md` is read-only during routine work
- `IDEA.md` is where project-specific values and product rules live
- Root and nested `AGENTS.md` files stay short and point back to `AI.md`
- `AGENTS.md` at the project root is a real-file copy of `AGENTS.md`'s exact content, kept in sync whenever `AGENTS.md` changes — never a symlink (not portable across all platforms/filesystems)
- If a loader file and `AI.md` disagree, `AI.md` wins
- `.codex/memory/` holds durable, project-specific knowledge discovered during
  development — decisions, gotchas, conventions unique to this codebase — distinct
  from `AI.md` (spec) and the loader files above. Committed to the repo, not
  gitignored. One markdown file per topic, YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`,
  `type: project`), indexed by `.codex/memory/MEMORY.md`, read on demand. Same
  credential-masking rule as everywhere else. `~/.codex/**` (global) stays
  read-only, deployed only via `codexmgr/config`'s `install.sh`; `.codex/memory/`
  here is read/write in this repo directly

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Language is Determined by IDEA.md

This is a generic template. The implementation language, toolchain, and build system are defined by `IDEA.md ## Project variables` (`language:` key). Before writing any code:

1. Read `IDEA.md` to determine the language
2. Check whether a language-specific template exists in `~/Projects/github/codexmgr/{language}/` and recommend upgrading AI.md to it
3. Apply the global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` language constraints for the detected language
4. If `language:` is missing from IDEA.md, ask — never assume

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Single Coherent Product

The deliverable is **one self-contained artifact** (binary, package, library, or service — defined by IDEA.md). The artifact must function correctly on first run with zero external setup beyond documented prerequisites.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Docker for All Builds

The language toolchain MUST NOT run on the host machine. All builds, tests, lint, and format checks execute inside a project-provided Docker container using the standard maintained image for the language (`casjaysdev/go:latest`, `casjaysdev/rust:latest`, `node:alpine`, `python:alpine`, etc.). Host role: edit files, run version control, orchestrate Docker.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Keep Documentation in Sync

Update these when their subject changes:
- `IDEA.md` when features or variables change
- `README.md` when install, usage, or packaging changes
- `LICENSE.md` when dependencies or attribution changes
- CI/CD docs or scripts when release mechanics change

## Licensing & Features

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MIT License** | All project code is MIT licensed unless IDEA.md explicitly states an additional compatible license policy |
| **3rd party attribution** | All third-party licenses are listed in `LICENSE.md` |
| **GPL / AGPL / LGPL denied by default** | Static linking would relicense the binary away from MIT; allowed only via a documented IDEA.md exception |
| **Free & open source** | No paid tiers, enterprise gating, or artificial feature segmentation |
| **No activation gates** | No license keys, phone-home unlocks, or paywalled code paths |

**NEVER implement:**
- upgrade/paywall prompts for core functionality
- telemetry-based licensing enforcement
- artificial limits used for monetization

# PART 1: PROJECT FILES & GOVERNANCE

## Project Files

| File | Purpose | Update When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **AI.md** | Implementation spec (HOW) — SOURCE OF TRUTH | Optional→required rule changes only |
| **IDEA.md** | Project plan (WHAT) | Features or variables change |
| **TODO.AI.md** | Task tracking (AI-owned) | Tasks added/completed |
| **TODO.md** | Task tracking (human-owned) | AI may mark done; never delete/empty |
| **PLAN.AI.md** | Implementation plan (AI-owned) | Planning new work |
| **PLAN.md** | Implementation plan (human-owned) | AI may mark done; never rewrite wholesale |
| **README.md** | User-facing install/usage docs | Usage changes |
| **LICENSE.md** | Project + dependency licenses | Dependency set changes |
| **release.txt** | Canonical release version when present | Release version changes |
| **site.txt** | Optional official site/homepage URL | Official site changes |

## Mandatory Compliance Schedule

| When | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Before each task | Read only the spec parts relevant to what you are about to implement — do not pre-load speculatively | Prevent token waste |
| Every 3–5 changes | Stop and verify against spec | Catch drift early |
| Before task completion | Full compliance check | Ensure correctness |
| When uncertain | Read that specific section — never guess | Accuracy without waste |

## Self-Validation Loop

**AI MUST verify its own work with real tools before reporting a task as done.**

| Change type | How to verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| Logic / library | Run the test suite inside the container; compare output against expected |
| CLI binary | Run in container; exercise flags including `--help`/`--version`; check stdout, stderr, exit code |
| Build | Build the artifact inside Docker; confirm exit 0 and artifact is produced |
| Bug fix | Reproduce the bug first, then verify the fix makes it disappear |
| Configuration | Start with the new config; verify defaults; verify validation rejects bad input |
| CI/CD | Run the workflow on a branch; verify each job's exit status |
| Documentation | Render locally; verify links and code samples work |

**Iteration rules:**
- A failed check is data, not failure — adjust and re-run until green
- Never report "done" while any verification is still red
- If a check reveals the change is wrong in a way that can't be patched, revert and re-plan

## Loader Files

| Tool | Primary Loader | Alternate Loader |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` in a nested directory |
| Other agents (Codex, Copilot, etc.) | `AGENTS.md` | - |

**Loader rule:** loader files stay short. Long-form content belongs in `IDEA.md` (product) and `AI.md` (implementation policy). `AGENTS.md` is always generated/reconciled as an exact real-file copy of root `AGENTS.md` — never a symlink (not portable across all platforms/filesystems).

## Reuse Before Creating

**Before writing new code for anything — a function, a variable/constant, or a UI component/style — check whether an equivalent already exists in the project and reuse or extend it. Only create something new when nothing existing covers the need.** This is a general project-wide rule, not restricted to any one feature.

- **Functions:** search for an existing one with the same or similar behavior before writing a new one; two near-identical functions differing only by a hardcoded value should be one function taking that value as a parameter.
- **Variables & Constants:** check existing constants, config keys, and enum values for one that already means the same thing before adding a new one.
- **Components / Styling:** check for an existing UI component, style class, or theme token before building a near-duplicate or hardcoding a new value. The concrete mechanism (CSS custom properties + classes for a web UI, a shared theme struct for TUI/CLI/desktop) is defined once the project's actual shape is known — see the `{lang|type}/{TYPE}.md` template that replaces this file, or `~/.codex/memory/ui_ux_conventions.md`.

Any feature that exports or imports data (audit logs, data exports, config/settings export, generated lists, etc.) uses the platform's native, no-JS-required mechanism for choosing the file path/name — a plain link/GET response with `Content-Disposition: attachment` for a web UI, a native OS save/open dialog for a desktop/mobile app — never a JS-only or custom in-app-only path. Full web-specific rules: `~/.codex/memory/ui_ux_conventions.md` → Import/Export.

# PART 2: APPLICATION MODEL

## Product Model

The artifact type, surfaces, and architecture are defined in `IDEA.md ## Business logic`. This template does not prescribe a specific model — IDEA.md does. Before implementing anything:

1. Read `IDEA.md ## Business logic` to determine: artifact type (binary, library, service, package), target surfaces (GUI, TUI, CLI, API, web), deployment model (self-hosted, cloud, embedded), and platform targets
2. Apply the single-coherent-product rule: shared core logic with thin surface adapters where multiple surfaces exist
3. If the artifact type is unclear or not stated in IDEA.md, ask — never assume

## Architectural Principles

Regardless of language or artifact type:

- **Single responsibility** — one coherent product; no unrelated subsystems bundled together
- **Shared core** — business logic lives in a shared layer, not duplicated per surface
- **Thin adapters** — UI/API/CLI layers are adapters over shared business rules
- **Self-contained** — the artifact runs on first use with zero config required (sensible defaults); user config is optional and additive
- **No runtime fetch** — all required assets are bundled or embedded at build time; no CDN/network fetch on first run

## Binary / Artifact Naming

Distribution artifacts follow:

```
{project_name}-{platform}-{arch}{.ext}
```

| Token | Values |
|-------|--------|
| `{platform}` | `linux`, `windows`, `macos`, `freebsd` (normalized — not raw OS values) |
| `{arch}` | `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7`, `i686` |
| `{.ext}` | `.exe` on Windows; empty elsewhere |

Local/dev artifact name: `{project_name}` (no platform/arch suffix).

## Release Checksums

Checksums ship as two aggregate manifests only: `sha256.txt` and `sha512.txt`, each covering the full release asset set (binaries, `version.txt`, source archive, SBOM). Per-artifact sidecar checksum files (`{artifact}.sha256`) are forbidden. The manifests are computed LAST — after every other asset is staged — over a single pre-captured file list, so both manifests cover the identical set and never hash each other.

---

# PART 3: BUILD, TOOLCHAIN, AND PACKAGING

## Docker Rule (Mandatory)

Docker is **REQUIRED**. The language toolchain MUST NOT run on the host.

### Required Docker Assets

```text
docker/
├── Dockerfile              # builds the dev/build/test image using official alpine language image
├── docker-compose.yml      # production/human runtime
├── docker-compose.dev.yml  # human development only (debug/devel)
├── docker-compose.test.yml # automated testing
├── entrypoint.sh           # sets non-root UID/GID, prepares cache dirs
└── README.md               # how to build, run tests, run the app
```

See `~/.codex/memory/dockerfile_conventions.md` for the required layout, fields, and rules for all three compose files.

### Mandatory Image Properties

- Base image: standard maintained image for the language (`casjaysdev/go:latest`, `casjaysdev/rust:latest`, `node:alpine`) — rolling, never pinned to a version tag
- Non-root user matching host UID/GID by default
- Language toolchain cache mounted as named volumes
- `CGO_ENABLED=0` for Go; static linking for Rust; equivalent for other languages

### Forbidden

- Running the language toolchain directly on the host
- Treating Docker as "CI-only" or "release-only"
- `--privileged` or `--net=host` without documented justification
- `docker run` without `--rm` for build/test containers; also flag `-it` on batch commands (breaks CI) and `--name` on batch containers (causes "container already in use" when multiple agents run concurrently)

## Build Rules

- Release builds strip debug symbols and produce minimal artifacts
- Cross-compilation targets at minimum: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`
- The final artifact MUST be a single statically linked binary (or equivalent self-contained package) per target
- All runtime assets embedded at build time — never fetched at runtime
- A static/self-contained check runs as part of CI

## Makefile

The project MUST have a `Makefile` with at minimum these targets:

| Target | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `make build` | Build the artifact inside Docker |
| `make test` | Run the test suite inside Docker |
| `make lint` | Run the linter inside Docker |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `make dev` | Start a development shell or dev server inside Docker |
| `make release` | Build release artifacts for all targets |

---

# PART 4: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION & SYSTEM INTEGRATION

## Core Rule

Privilege escalation is allowed but **optional** and only when the user explicitly requests it.

## NEVER Do

- Never auto-run `sudo`, `pkexec`, UAC elevation, or similar without explicit user request
- Never silently switch from user-scope to system-scope install
- Never require elevation for normal app launch, per-user config, or per-user updates

## Default Scope Rule

Default to **user scope**: user config, user data, user cache, per-user integrations.

## Path Rule

On-disk paths use the frozen pair `{internal_org}` and `{internal_name}` only — never the mutable `{project_org}` / `{project_name}`. This protects user data across project/org renames.

| Purpose | Linux / BSD | macOS | Windows |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Config | `~/.config/{internal_org}/{internal_name}/` | `~/Library/Application Support/{internal_name}/config/` | `%AppData%\{internal_org}\{internal_name}\config\` |
| Data | `~/.local/share/{internal_org}/{internal_name}/` | `~/Library/Application Support/{internal_name}/data/` | `%LocalAppData%\{internal_org}\{internal_name}\data\` |
| Cache | `~/.cache/{internal_org}/{internal_name}/` | `~/Library/Caches/{internal_name}/` | `%LocalAppData%\{internal_org}\{internal_name}\cache\` |
| Logs | `~/.local/state/{internal_org}/{internal_name}/logs/` | `~/Library/Logs/{internal_name}/` | `%LocalAppData%\{internal_org}\{internal_name}\logs\` |

---

# PART 5: VERSION, SITE, AND BUILD METADATA

## `release.txt` (Canonical Version)

- Single-line file at project root containing the canonical version string
- Use semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) unless IDEA.md documents another scheme
- CI/CD and release scripts MUST read version from `release.txt`, not invent one
- Keep in sync with the language module/package version declaration (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, etc.)

## `site.txt` (Optional)

- Single-line file containing the official homepage URL when applicable
- Embedded into the binary at build time via `-ldflags` or equivalent

## Build Metadata Injection

**Single time source:** every build captures one build epoch — `date -u +%s` — exactly once per build. Any human-readable build date is DERIVED from that epoch; it is never captured separately.

Inject at build time (via `-ldflags`, `build.rs`, `build.js`, or equivalent):

| Variable | Default | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `Version` | `dev` | `release.txt` |
| `CommitID` | `unknown` | `git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD` |
| `BuildEpoch` | `0` | `date -u +%s` (captured once per build) |
| `OfficialSite` | `` | `site.txt` (if present) |

The artifact embeds version, commit id, and build epoch. Version strings come from `release.txt` — hardcoded version literals anywhere in code, scripts, or CI are violations.

---

# PART 6: SECURITY & PRIVACY

## Security Defaults

- **Fail closed** — when in doubt, deny and explain; never silently allow
- **Least privilege** — request only permissions actually needed; drop them as soon as no longer needed
- **No security through obscurity** — assume the attacker knows your code; security must hold even so
- **Defense in depth** — layer authentication, authorization, input validation, output encoding, rate limiting independently
- **Parameterized queries** — never interpolate user input into SQL, shell commands, or template strings
- **Constant-time comparison** — for all credential/token comparison operations
- **No hardcoded secrets** — credentials via environment variables or a secrets manager only

## Rate Limiting

All auth endpoints (login, password reset, OTP, token refresh) must have rate limiting with exponential backoff and lockout.

## Audit Logging

Security-relevant events (auth success/failure, permission changes, admin actions, data exports) must be logged. Logs are append-only and never contain raw credentials.

## Dependency Security

Run `govulncheck` (Go) / `cargo audit` (Rust) / `npm audit` (Node) / equivalent before adding any dependency and before committing. Never ship a critical/high CVE in direct dependencies.

## Password Hashing

**Argon2id only** — never bcrypt, never scrypt, never MD5/SHA for passwords.

---

# PART 7: TESTING & QUALITY

## Test Requirements

- Every non-trivial function has at least one test
- Tests cover the happy path, edge cases, and error paths
- New behavior requires a test that fails before and passes after the fix
- Tests run inside Docker — never on the host toolchain

## Quality Gates

All of these must be green before committing:

| Check | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Formatting | Language formatter (`gofmt`, `rustfmt`, `prettier`, etc.) |
| Linting | Language linter (`golangci-lint`, `clippy`, `eslint`, etc.) |
| Tests | Language test runner (`go test`, `cargo test`, `jest`, etc.) |
| Security | Vulnerability scanner (`govulncheck`, `cargo audit`, `npm audit`, etc.) |
| Build | Artifact builds without error |

**Zero tolerance** — lint warnings are treated as errors in CI.

---

# PART 8: CI/CD, RELEASES, AND AUTOMATION

## CI Requirements

The project MUST have CI that runs on every push and pull request:

- Format check
- Lint
- Test suite
- Build (all target platforms)
- Security/vulnerability scan
- Static-binary self-check (confirm artifact has no unexpected dynamic dependencies)

## One Canonical Release Flow

All release channels (stable, beta, daily) run the identical pipeline skeleton:

build → stage assets → `version.txt` → source archive → SBOM → checksum manifests LAST → provenance attestation (only where the platform supports it, e.g. GitHub) → publish

Channels differ ONLY in context, never in steps:

| Channel | Trigger | Tag / version identity | Prerelease | Retention |
|---------|---------|------------------------|------------|-----------|
| Stable | Version tag | Tag is the version | No | Permanent |
| Beta | Beta branch push | Timestamp-beta tag | Yes | Limited |
| Daily | Schedule | Rolling `daily` tag, deleted and recreated each run; version = short commit id | Yes | Rolling |

Never fork the pipeline logic per channel — one skeleton, parameterized by context.

Every workflow (CI and every release channel) must also support an on-demand manual run in addition to its normal trigger, so it can be re-run without a dummy commit — `workflow_dispatch` on GitHub/Gitea/Forgejo; GitLab and Jenkins pipelines are already manually runnable from their own UI with no extra config.
