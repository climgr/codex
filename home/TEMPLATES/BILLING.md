## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

### Purpose
This specification defines a complete billing and subscription management system designed to be integrated into any type of project—SaaS applications, self-hosted software, enterprise platforms, marketplaces, or digital services. It provides flexible subscription management, multi-provider payment processing (with 47+ providers all disabled by default), usage-based billing, tax compliance, and comprehensive financial controls with integrated setup guidance.

### Scope
- **Language/Framework Agnostic**: Implementable in any programming language or framework
- **Database Agnostic**: Works with any database system (SQL or NoSQL)
- **Payment Provider Agnostic**: Supports 47+ payment gateways, all disabled by default
- **Deployment Agnostic**: Cloud, on-premise, hybrid, or distributed
- **Business Model Agnostic**: Subscription, one-time, usage-based, or hybrid pricing
- **Configuration Method**: Web UI only, no config files or environment variables

### What This Specification Defines
- Billing state machines and transitions
- Payment processing workflows with 47+ provider options
- Tax calculation and compliance rules
- Usage metering and enforcement
- Administrative and user interfaces with integrated help
- Security and compliance requirements
- Failure scenarios and recovery procedures
- In-UI setup guidance and tooltips

### What This Specification Does NOT Define
- Specific payment provider APIs
- Database schemas or table structures
- API endpoint URLs or naming conventions
- Currency conversion rates or methods
- Specific tax rates or jurisdictions
- Visual design or UI layouts
- Third-party service credentials
- Implementation language or framework

---

## 🏗️ Core Design Principles

### 1. Provider Independence & Zero-Default
**Principle**: System ships with NO active payment providers. All 47+ providers are disabled by default.
- All providers disabled on installation
- Web UI configuration required for activation
- System works with zero providers (invoice-only)
- No vendor lock-in
- Provider credentials never in code

### 2. Billing Continuity
**Principle**: Billing operations must continue even when providers fail.
- Invoices always generated
- Grace periods for failures
- Offline operation capability
- Automatic reconciliation
- Failover through enabled providers

### 3. Transparency & Auditability
**Principle**: Every billing action must be traceable and reversible.
- Complete audit trails
- Immutable invoice records
- Clear state transitions
- Detailed activity logs
- Provider action tracking

### 4. Global Readiness
**Principle**: Support international commerce from day one.
- Multi-currency support
- Regional tax compliance
- Localized invoice formats
- Time zone awareness
- Regional payment methods

### 5. User Control
**Principle**: Users maintain control over their billing relationship.
- Self-service capabilities
- Clear cancellation processes
- Data portability
- No dark patterns
- Transparent pricing

### 6. Graceful Degradation
**Principle**: System degrades gracefully under failure conditions.
- Provider failures don't block access
- Tax service failures use cached rates
- Payment failures trigger grace periods
- Service continues during disputes
- Invoice-only mode fallback

### 7. Self-Contained Documentation
**Principle**: All setup instructions and help are within the UI.
- Integrated tooltips on every field
- Provider setup guides in-UI
- No external documentation needed
- Interactive troubleshooting
- Contextual help everywhere

7. DOCUMENT: For compliance
```

### Tax Determination

#### Location Detection
```
Priority Order:
1. Tax registration address
2. Billing address
3. IP geolocation (supplementary)
4. Payment method country
5. Default jurisdiction
```

#### B2B vs B2C
```
B2B Detection:
  - Valid tax ID provided
  - Verification passed
  - Business address confirmed
  
B2B Treatment:
  - Reverse charge (EU)
  - Tax exempt (some jurisdictions)
  - Different rates (some products)
  
B2C Treatment:
  - Full tax applied
  - Simplified invoicing
  - Consumer protections
```

### Compliance Features

#### Tax ID Validation
```
EU VAT: VIES API check
UK VAT: HMRC verification  
US EIN: Format validation
AU ABN: ABR lookup
IN GST: GSTIN verification
[Validation includes tooltips for each]
```

#### Threshold Monitoring
```
Per-Jurisdiction Tracking:
  - Sales volume
  - Transaction count
  - Customer count
  
When threshold approaching:
  - Alert administrators
  - Show guidance in UI
  - Update tax logic
```

### Tax Provider Integration

#### Provider Abstraction
```
Interface TaxProvider {
  - calculate_tax()
  - validate_tax_id()
  - get_rates()
  - file_return() (optional)
  - get_nexus_list()
}
```

#### Fallback Handling
```
IF primary_provider_fails THEN
  Try secondary_provider
  ELSE use_cached_rates
  ELSE use_default_rates
  ALWAYS generate_invoice
```

## 🤖 AI Development Guidelines (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI is for Development, NOT Required in Production

**AI tools are used ONLY during development to:**
- Generate provider integration code
- Create state machine implementations
- Build test scenarios
- Generate tooltip content
- Create migration scripts

**The production system:**
- May or may not use AI/ML (implementation choice)
- All core billing logic is deterministic
- Provider integrations are rule-based
- State transitions are explicit
- No AI required for operation

### Using AI Development Tools

#### Initial Setup with AI
```bash
# Example using Codex
$ codex "Implement billing system based on specification with:
  - 47+ payment providers (all disabled by default)
  - Web UI configuration only
  - Provider plugin architecture
  - Complex state machines
  - Integrated help system"
```

#### AI-Generated Provider Plugins
```bash
# Generate provider implementation
$ codex "Create Stripe provider plugin including:
  - Interface implementation
  - Webhook handling
  - Error mapping
  - Retry logic
  - Tooltip content
  - Setup guide"

# Generate all provider stubs
$ codex "Generate plugin stubs for all 47 providers"
```

#### State Machine Implementation
```bash
$ codex "Generate subscription state machine:
  - All states from spec
  - Transition validation
  - Event handling
  - Test coverage"
```

#### Test Generation
```bash
$ codex "Create comprehensive test suite:
  - Provider failover scenarios
  - Grace period handling
  - Multi-currency calculations
  - All state transitions
  - Webhook processing"
```

### What AI Generates

#### Per-Provider Components
- Payment method tokenization
- Subscription management
- Webhook event handling
- Error code mapping
- Currency handling
- Retry logic
- Test data
- Setup documentation
- Tooltip content

#### System Components
- State machines
- Proration calculations
- Tax calculation logic
- Failover routing
- Reconciliation processes
- Migration scripts
- Database schemas

### AI Development Best Practices

**DO:**
- Use AI to generate provider plugins from templates
- Have AI create comprehensive test suites
- Let AI generate tooltip and help content
- Use AI for migration scripts
- Generate documentation with AI

**DON'T:**
- Rely on AI for financial calculations in production
- Use AI for real-time payment decisions
- Let AI generate security credentials
- Use AI for compliance decisions
- Generate production API keys with AI

**VALIDATE:**
- All state machines match specification
- Provider interfaces are complete
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Security requirements are met
- Help content is accurate

### Production Considerations

**What happens in production:**
- All provider plugins run as deterministic code
- State machines execute predefined transitions
- Calculations follow explicit formulas
- Failover uses configured priority
- No AI required for any billing operation

**Optional AI/ML in Production** (Implementation Choice):
- Fraud detection (separate from billing logic)
- Churn prediction (analytics layer)
- Optimal retry timing (enhancement only)
- Revenue forecasting (reporting feature)
- These are OPTIONAL additions, not requirements

---

## 💡 Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Patterns

#### Recommended Patterns
```
Event-Driven:
  - All state changes emit events
  - Async processing where possible
  - Event sourcing for audit
  
Microservices:
  - Billing as separate service
  - Clear API boundaries
  - Independent scaling
  
Plugin Architecture:
  - Each provider as plugin
  - Dynamic loading
  - Interface compliance
```

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
```
DON'T:
  - Store sensitive payment data directly
  - Hard-code provider credentials
  - Use environment variables for provider config
  - Enable providers by default
  - Skip tooltip implementation
  - Make synchronous external calls in transactions
  - Allow financial operations without audit
  - Trust client-side calculations
  - Store API keys in code
```

### Provider Implementation

#### Provider Plugin Architecture
```
Each provider should be:
  - Self-contained module/plugin
  - Dynamically loadable
  - Configuration-driven
  - Interface compliant
  - Independently testable
  - Include help content
  
Provider Directory Structure (example):
  /providers
    /stripe
      - provider.js (implements interface)
      - config.schema.json
      - webhook.handler.js
      - tooltips.json (help content)
      - tests.js
    /paypal
      - (same structure)
    [... 45 more providers]
```

#### Provider Registry
```
System maintains registry of:
  - Available providers (all 47+)
  - Enabled providers (user configured)
  - Provider capabilities
  - Provider health status
  - Provider configuration
  - Help content per provider
  
No provider code runs unless:
  - Explicitly enabled via web UI
  - Configuration validated
  - Credentials verified
  - Tests passed
```

#### Configuration Storage
```
Provider configurations stored in:
  - Database (encrypted)
  - Never in code
  - Never in environment variables
  - Never in config files
  - Accessible only via admin UI
  - Audited on every change
  - Includes tooltip content
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Test Coverage Required
```
Unit Tests:
  - Calculation logic
  - State transitions
  - Business rules
  - Each provider plugin
  
Integration Tests:
  - Provider interactions
  - Webhook processing
  - API endpoints
  - Failover scenarios
  
End-to-End Tests:
  - Complete billing cycles
  - Provider switching
  - Upgrade/downgrade flows
  - Payment failure handling
  
Performance Tests:
  - High volume processing
  - Multiple provider load
  - Concurrent operations
  - Rate limiting
```

### Migration Strategy

#### From Existing System
```
Phase 1: Read-only mode
  - Import existing data
  - Map to new structure
  - Verify accuracy
  - Run in parallel
  
Phase 2: New customers only
  - Test with subset
  - Use limited providers
  - Monitor closely
  - Fix issues
  
Phase 3: Gradual migration
  - Migrate by cohort
  - Enable providers gradually
  - Maintain old system
  - Provide rollback
  
Phase 4: Full cutover
  - Migrate remaining
  - Enable all needed providers
  - Decommission old
  - Archive data
```

*This specification is designed to be completely implementation-agnostic and can be adapted to any technology stack, business model, or deployment environment. The billing system should integrate with your existing application while maintaining clear boundaries and separation of concerns.*

*All 47+ payment providers are available but disabled by default. Configuration is done exclusively through the web UI with integrated help and tooltips. No external documentation is required for provider setup.*

*AI tools can assist in development but are not required for production operation. The core billing logic is deterministic and does not require any machine learning or AI to function.*
