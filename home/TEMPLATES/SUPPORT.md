## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

### Purpose
This specification defines a complete support system designed to be integrated into any type of project—SaaS applications, hosting platforms, self-hosted tools, enterprise systems, or web applications. It provides structured ticket management, intelligent bot pre-screening with built-in patterns that work out-of-the-box, live chat capabilities, and comprehensive admin oversight.

### Scope
- **Language/Framework Agnostic**: Implementable in any programming language or framework
- **Database Agnostic**: Works with any database system (SQL or NoSQL)
- **Authentication Agnostic**: Integrates with any existing auth system
- **Deployment Agnostic**: Cloud, on-premise, or hybrid deployments
- **Scale Agnostic**: Single user to enterprise-scale operations

### What This Specification Defines
- Behavioral requirements and user flows
- Data structures and relationships
- Security and access control rules
- User interface requirements and interactions
- Integration points and APIs
- Configuration options and constraints

### What This Specification Does NOT Define
- Specific programming languages or frameworks
- Database schemas or table structures
- API endpoint URLs, paths, or naming conventions
- File system paths or directory structures
- Visual design, colors, or branding
- Specific third-party service integrations
- Internal implementation details

## 🏗️ Core Design Principles

### 1. User Agency Over Automation
**Principle**: While automation enhances efficiency, users maintain ultimate control over all decisions.
- Bot suggestions can always be overridden
- No automated action is final without user confirmation
- Users can modify any auto-populated data
- Clear indication of what is automated vs. user-entered

### 2. Privacy by Design
**Principle**: User data and support interactions remain private and secure.
- Tickets visible only to creator and support agents
- Support agents' admin privileges are never exposed to users
- All data access is logged and auditable
- Minimal data collection policy

### 3. Mobile-First, Accessibility-Always
**Principle**: The system must be fully functional on all devices and for all users.
- Responsive design that works on screens from 320px to 4K
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- Touch-optimized interfaces for mobile devices
- Reduced motion options for users with vestibular disorders

### 4. Configuration Through UI Only
**Principle**: All system configuration happens through web interfaces, no code or file editing required.
- Admin configuration panel for system settings
- Agent configuration panel for personal settings
- No command-line or file-based configuration
- All settings have sensible defaults
- Configuration changes take effect immediately (no restart required)

### 5. Fail Gracefully
**Principle**: When components fail, the system degrades gracefully.
- If bot fails → direct ticket creation remains available
- If chat fails → ticket system remains functional
- If email fails → in-app notifications continue
- Clear error messages for users and agents
- Automatic recovery when services restore

```
- Admin manually assigns roles through web interface
- Immediate effect upon assignment
- Roles stored in application database

#### Method 2: External Authentication Mapping
```
External Auth Provider → Attribute/Claim → Role Mapping → Permissions
```
- LDAP group membership (e.g., "cn=support-staff,ou=groups,dc=company,dc=com")
- OAuth claims (e.g., "roles": ["support"])
- SAML attributes (e.g., "Department": "Customer Support")
- Automatic role sync on login
- Configurable mapping rules via UI

### Support Group Membership
- Both regular users and system administrators can be in the support group
- Support group members must switch to "Support Mode" to act as agents
- Administrators never appear as "Admin" to users - always as support agents with their configured display name

## 👥 Support Agent System

### Support Mode Toggle

#### Entering Support Mode
**Trigger Methods**:
1. Manual toggle switch in navigation bar
2. Accessing support dashboard URL directly
3. Clicking "Enter Support Mode" from user dashboard

## 🤖 Bot Automation System (Logic-Based, No AI/ML)

### Core Principle: Deterministic Logic Only

**Production Runtime**:
- Pure pattern matching (regex, string comparison)
- Static, pre-compiled patterns
- Deterministic responses
- No machine learning inference
- No API calls to AI services
- 100% predictable behavior
- Works completely offline

### Architecture

#### Components

**1. Knowledge Base Scanner**
- Indexes all documentation on startup
- Refreshes index when documents change
- Creates searchable patterns from content
- Maintains relevance scoring

**Security Note**: The bot operates in a completely isolated environment. Its pattern database, error codes, and solution mappings are never exposed through any endpoint, API, or interface. This prevents reverse engineering of support patterns and protects against exploitation.

**2. Error Database** (Internal system component - completely isolated)

**Access Restrictions**:
- Not exposed via any API endpoint
- Not accessible through web UI
- Not visible to support agents
- Only accessible by the bot process itself
- No human-readable interface needed
- Stored in optimized format for your implementation

**Storage Format Examples** (Implementation Choice):
```
Option 1: Database table (encrypted)
Option 2: Compiled into application binary
Option 3: In-memory data structure
Option 4: Secure key-value store
Option 5: Whatever works for your architecture
```

The actual format depends on your tech stack - could be:
- Database rows
- Compiled constants
- Binary data
- Encrypted configuration
- Memory-mapped files
- Redis/cache layer

**Security Requirements**:
- Runs in isolated process/container
- No network exposure
- Read-only access from bot process
- Updated only through secure deployment
- No logging of actual patterns (security through obscurity)

**3. Pattern Matching Engine**
- Regex-based pattern matching
- Exact string matching for error codes
- Keyword density analysis
- Confidence scoring (0-100)
- Only responds at 100% confidence
- **NO AI/ML** - Uses pre-generated patterns only
- Patterns loaded from implementation-specific storage
- Could be from database, memory, compiled code, etc.

**4. Conversation Manager**
- Maintains conversation context
- Tracks attempted solutions
- Generates ticket payload
- Manages retry counter
- Maximum 3 attempts before creating ticket

### Built-in Pattern Recognition (No Configuration Needed)

**Hybrid Approach: Universal + Project-Specific Patterns**

The bot uses two layers of patterns:
1. **Universal Patterns** (Built-in) - Work for any project
2. **Project Patterns** (AI-Generated at build time) - Specific to your codebase

When using AI tools like Codex during implementation, the AI will:
- Keep all universal patterns as the foundation
- Scan your project for specific errors, endpoints, features
- Generate additional patterns unique to your system
- Compile both into the optimized bot database
- No manual configuration required

**Pre-defined Universal Patterns**:
The bot comes with standard patterns that work for any system:

**Authentication Issues**:
- Patterns: "can't log in", "cannot login", "authentication failed", "invalid password", "account locked"
- Solutions: Clear cache, reset password, check account status
- Auto-detects: Email validation issues, 2FA problems

**Performance Issues**:
- Patterns: "slow", "loading forever", "takes too long", "not responding", "frozen"
- Solutions: Check connection, clear cache, try different browser, check system status
- Auto-detects: Timeout errors, latency issues

**Access/Permission Issues**:
- Patterns: "access denied", "not authorized", "permission denied", "can't access", "forbidden"
- Solutions: Verify account permissions, check subscription status, contact admin for access
- Auto-detects: 403 errors, role-based access issues

**Error Messages**:
- Patterns: Any message containing "error", "exception", "failed to", specific error codes
- Solutions: Searches knowledge base for error code, provides standard troubleshooting
- Auto-detects: Stack traces, error codes, system messages

**Payment/Billing**:
- Patterns: "payment failed", "card declined", "billing", "subscription", "refund"
- Solutions: Update payment method, check card details, verify billing address
- Auto-detects: Transaction IDs, payment processor responses

**Data/Sync Issues**:
- Patterns: "not syncing", "data missing", "lost my", "disappeared", "not saving"
- Solutions: Check connection, refresh, verify auto-save settings, check recycle bin
- Auto-detects: Sync conflicts, version mismatches

**Installation/Setup**:
- Patterns: "how to install", "setup", "getting started", "first time", "new user"
- Solutions: Links to quick start guide, setup checklist, video tutorials
- Auto-detects: Configuration issues, missing dependencies

**Bug Reports**:
- Patterns: "bug", "broken", "doesn't work", "not working properly"
- Solutions: Gather browser/OS info, steps to reproduce, known issues check
- Auto-detects: Browser console errors, device-specific issues

**How-to Questions**:
- Patterns: "how do I", "how to", "where is", "can't find"
- Solutions: Searches documentation, provides navigation help
- Auto-detects: Feature location questions, UI navigation

**Account Management**:
- Patterns: "delete account", "change email", "update profile", "cancel subscription"
- Solutions: Links to account settings, provides step-by-step guide
- Auto-detects: Profile update requests, account closure

### Smart Pattern Matching Logic

**Built-in Intelligence** (No configuration required):
1. **Error Code Detection**: Automatically extracts any pattern like "ERR_*", "ERROR *", "[0-9]{3,5}" 
2. **URL Detection**: Identifies problematic URLs or pages mentioned
3. **Timestamp Detection**: Recognizes when issues occurred
4. **Frequency Detection**: Identifies if user mentions "always", "sometimes", "randomly"
5. **Urgency Detection**: Recognizes "urgent", "ASAP", "production down", "critical"
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Simple negative keyword detection for escalation

**Category Auto-Detection**:
- Technical (errors, bugs, performance)
- Account (login, profile, permissions)
- Billing (payment, subscription, refunds)
- General (how-to, features, documentation)

### Bot Interaction Flow

#### Phase 1: Initial Contact (Mandatory Before Ticket Creation)
```
User: Clicks "Get Support"
     ↓
Bot: "Hello! I'm the support bot. I'll try to help you resolve your issue quickly. 
      Please describe what you're experiencing."
     ↓
User: Describes issue
     ↓
Bot: Analyzes input
```

#### Phase 2: Solution Attempts (Maximum 3)

**Attempt Structure**:
```
Bot: "I found something that might help with [issue summary]:"
     
     📚 Relevant Article: [Title with link]
     
     Solution Steps:
     1. [Step one with specific action]
     2. [Step two with expected result]
     3. [Step three if needed]
     
     ⚡ Quick Actions:
     [Button: Clear Cache] [Button: Reset Password] [Button: Check Status]
     
     Did this resolve your issue?
     [Yes, resolved] [No, still having issues]
```

**If User Says "No"**:
- Bot attempts up to 2 more different solutions
- Each attempt must be substantially different
- Bot tracks what has been tried

**If User Says "Yes"**:
- Bot confirms resolution
- Asks for optional feedback
- Logs successful resolution pattern
- Ends conversation

#### Phase 3: Ticket Creation (After 3 Failed Attempts)

**Bot Response**:
```
Bot: "I understand this issue needs human attention. I'll help you create a 
      support ticket with the information we've gathered."
      
      Here's what I've prepared:
      • Issue Summary: [Generated from conversation]
      • Solutions Attempted: [List of tried solutions]
      • Category: [Auto-detected category]
      • Priority: [Based on urgency keywords]
      
      [Open Ticket Form]
```

**Generated Ticket Payload**:
- Title (auto-generated from issue keywords)
- Description (user's original description + context)
- Category (auto-detected)
- Priority (based on keywords: production, urgent, etc.)
- Bot conversation history
- Solutions already attempted
- Metadata (timestamp, user agent, referrer)

**User Control**:
- User can modify ALL fields before submission
- Change category if bot was wrong
- Adjust priority level
- Add additional details
- User must click "Submit Ticket" - bot never saves

### Optional Admin Overrides

While the system works out-of-the-box with built-in patterns (and AI-generated patterns if using AI tools), admins can optionally:
- **Disable** specific built-in patterns (not modify them)
- **Add** organization-specific patterns for unique features
- **Set** category priorities
- **Configure** escalation keywords for their industry
- **Toggle** bot on/off entirely

**Admin UI Simplified**:
```
Bot Configuration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Status: [● Enabled ○ Disabled]

Built-in Patterns: ✓ Active (Recommended)

Custom Patterns (Optional):
[+ Add Organization-Specific Pattern]

Escalation Words (Optional):
[Default list + Add custom words]

[Save Settings]
```

### Bot Limitations

**Cannot Do**:
- Make changes to user accounts
- Access private user data
- Close or resolve tickets
- Save tickets (user must confirm)
- Override user decisions
- Respond below 100% confidence
- Access external APIs without configuration

**Must Do**:
- Clearly identify as bot
- Show confidence level
- Log all interactions
- Respect user choices
- Provide escape to human support
- Maintain conversation context
- Generate accurate ticket summaries

### Bot Analytics

**Tracked Metrics**:
- Resolution rate (solved without ticket)
- Average attempts before resolution
- Most common patterns
- Failed pattern matches
- User satisfaction scores
- Time to resolution
- Category distribution
- User override frequency (when they change bot's categorization)

## 💬 Live Chat System

### Availability Logic

#### System Availability Check
```
Is Chat Available = (
  At least one agent status == "Available" AND
  Total active chats < max_concurrent_chats AND
  Current time within business hours (if configured) AND
  Chat feature enabled globally
)
```

#### User Interface Changes

**When Available**:
```html
[💬 Live Chat - Agent Available]
Click to start a conversation
```

**When Unavailable**:
```html
[📧 Leave a Message]
No agents available - Create a ticket
Expected response time: ~2 hours
```

### Chat Initialization

#### User Starts Chat

**Pre-chat Form** (Optional):
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Start Live Chat             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Name: [_______________]     │
│ Email: [______________]     │
│ Topic: [Dropdown      ▼]    │
│                             │
│ [Start Chat] [Cancel]       │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Chat Assignment**:
1. System finds available agents
2. Applies routing rules:
   - Least busy (fewest active chats)
   - Round-robin
   - Specialty matching
   - Previous agent (if configured)
3. Assigns to selected agent
4. Notifies agent immediately

### Chat Interface

#### User View

## 📬 Notifications

### Notification Channels

#### 1. Email Notifications
**Templates Location**: Configured via Web UI
**Sending Triggers**: Real-time or batched
**Required Templates**:
- Ticket created confirmation
- Agent response
- Ticket resolved
- Chat transcript
- Password reset
- SLA warning

**Template Variables**: catalog-only (channel-agnostic); actual delimiter
syntax is per-channel/per-engine. When the host project already ships an
email-template engine (Go/Rust `SERVER.md`/`API.md`/`HYBRID.md` § EMAIL &
NOTIFICATIONS), defer to it — that engine uses plain `{variable}` string
substitution only, not Handlebars-style `{{variable}}`:
```
{user_name} - Recipient name
{ticket_id} - Ticket identifier
{ticket_title} - Ticket subject
{agent_name} - Responding agent
{response_content} - Latest message
{ticket_link} - Direct link to ticket
{unsubscribe_link} - Opt-out link
```

#### 2. In-App Notifications
**Display**: Badge counter + dropdown
**Persistence**: Until marked read
**Types**:
- New response on ticket
- Ticket status change
- Chat request
- System announcements

#### 3. Browser Push (Optional)
**Requires**: User permission
**When**: Immediate for urgent items
**Content**: Brief with action link

### Notification Rules

#### User Preferences
Configurable per user:
- Email for ticket updates
- Email for status changes
- In-app notifications
- Push notifications
- Quiet hours
- Batching preferences

#### Smart Batching
- Combine multiple updates within 5 minutes
- Never batch urgent/SLA notifications
- Respect user's time zone
- Don't send between 10 PM - 8 AM (configurable)

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Authentication Integration

#### Supported Methods
1. **Session-based**: Existing app sessions
2. **Token-based**: JWT, OAuth tokens
3. **SSO**: SAML, OpenID Connect
4. **API Keys**: For external integrations

#### Session Management
- Support sessions inherit main app timeout
- Separate "remember me" for support mode
- Force re-auth for sensitive operations
- Concurrent session limits (optional)

### Data Access Controls

#### Bot System Isolation
**Complete Separation**:
- Bot pattern database has no API endpoints
- No URL routes to bot internals
- No database queries can access bot patterns
- Support agents cannot view bot logic
- Even admins only configure via UI, never see compiled format

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents pattern exploitation
- Protects business logic
- Avoids social engineering (users can't learn what triggers solutions)
- Maintains security through obscurity
- Reduces attack surface

#### Ticket Visibility Matrix
```
              View Own | View All | Modify Own | Modify All
Guest         Limited  |    No    |     No     |     No
User            Yes    |    No    |    Yes     |     No
Support (Off)   Yes    |    No    |    Yes     |     No
Support (On)    N/A    |   Yes    |     No     |    Yes
Admin           N/A    |   Yes    |     No     |    Yes
```

#### Sensitive Data Handling
- PII masked in logs
- Credit cards never stored
- Passwords never in tickets
- Attachments virus-scanned
- Data retention policies enforced

### Rate Limiting

#### Configurable Limits
```yaml
Guest:
  ticket_create: "3 per hour"
  kb_search: "30 per minute"
  file_upload: "10 MB per file"

User:
  ticket_create: "10 per hour"
  chat_messages: "60 per minute"
  file_upload: "25 MB per file"

Agent:
  no_limits_in_support_mode: true
  normal_user_limits_otherwise: true
```

### Audit Logging

## 🤖 AI Integration Guidelines (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: AI is for Development, NOT Production

**AI tools are used ONLY during development to:**
- Generate pattern matching rules
- Create the compiled bot database
- Analyze your codebase for patterns
- Build the logic rules

**The production system:**
- Runs pure logic-based pattern matching
- No AI/ML inference at runtime
- No external API calls to AI services
- Completely deterministic responses
- 100% self-contained and offline-capable

### Using AI Development Tools (e.g., Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor)

#### Initial Setup Prompt
```
I'm implementing a support system based on the provided specification. 
Key requirements:
- Logic-based bot (no AI/ML for responses)
- Web UI configuration only
- Support mode toggle for agents
- Bot pre-screening before ticket creation
- Integration with existing [auth system/database/framework]
```

#### AI-Powered Pattern Generation (BUILD TIME ONLY)

**Development Time (WITH AI)**:
```bash
# AI analyzes code and generates patterns
$ codex "Generate bot pattern database from project"

# Output: Static pattern data in whatever format suits your implementation:
# - Compiled into the application binary
# - Embedded in the database during deployment
# - Stored as encrypted configuration
# - Built into a constants file
# - Whatever works for your architecture
```

**Production Runtime (NO AI)**:
```
// Production bot loads patterns from wherever they're stored
// Could be from database, compiled code, config, etc.
// Pure regex/string matching, no AI inference
// Deterministic responses based on pattern matching
```

**Pattern Storage Options** (Implementation Choice):
- Compiled into application code
- Seeded into database tables
- Embedded in binary resources
- Stored in secure configuration
- Built as part of deployment artifacts
- Whatever suits your tech stack

**What AI Tools Can Auto-Detect (During Build)**:
```
Based on your project, AI can identify:
- Your API endpoints and their error responses
- Your database schema and common query errors
- Your authentication flow and failure points
- Your documentation structure and help articles
- Your specific feature names and UI elements
- Your error code format and meanings
- Your business logic and validation rules
```

**Example AI Pattern Generation**:
```bash
# Codex can analyze your project and generate patterns
$ codex "Analyze this project and generate bot patterns for:
- All API endpoints and their possible errors
- All form validations and their messages  
- All features mentioned in our documentation
- All error codes in our error constants file
- Common issues based on our GitHub issues"

# AI generates project-specific patterns that complement universal ones
```

### Implementation Strategy with AI Tools

**1. Modular Implementation Approach**:
Break down the specification into modules for AI to implement:
```
1. User authentication integration
2. Ticket CRUD operations
3. Bot pattern matching engine
4. Support mode switching
5. Live chat websocket handling
6. Knowledge base search
7. Notification system
8. Admin configuration UI
```

**2. Provide Context Files**:
When using AI tools, include:
- This specification document
- Your existing authentication schema
- Your database models
- Your API structure
- Your UI framework components

**3. Key Prompts for Each Module**:

**For Bot System**:
```
Implement a pattern-matching bot that:
- Uses built-in universal patterns (works out-of-the-box)
- PLUS AI-generated project-specific patterns from:
  * Your error constants/enums
  * Your API endpoint responses
  * Your validation messages
  * Your documentation files
  * Your database constraints
- Uses regex and exact string matching (no AI/ML for responses)
- Only responds at 100% confidence
- Attempts 3 solutions maximum
- Creates pre-filled ticket payload after failures
- Never saves tickets directly
Reference: [Bot Automation System section - Built-in Pattern Recognition]

Example: If your project has a 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED' error,
AI will automatically create pattern and solution for it.
```

**For Support Mode**:
```
Implement support mode toggle that:
- Shows clear banner when active (not sticky on mobile)
- Disables ticket creation for agents
- Switches UI context completely
- Maintains user session separately
Reference: [Support Agent System section]
```

**For Ticket System**:
```
Implement ticket lifecycle with states:
DRAFT → OPEN → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_USER 
→ AWAITING_AGENT → RESOLVED → CLOSED → REOPENED
With proper state transition rules and permissions
Reference: [Ticket Lifecycle section]
```

### Testing Scenarios for AI to Generate

Ask AI to create test cases for:
- User can't create tickets in support mode
- Bot correctly generates ticket payload
- Chat fallback when no agents available
- Ticket state transitions
- Permission matrix enforcement
- Rate limiting for different user types
- Support mode banner displays correctly
- Agent display names show properly

### Best Practices for AI Implementation

**DO:**
- Provide the full specification as context
- Break down into smaller, testable components
- Ask AI to follow the state machine strictly
- Request unit tests for each component
- Have AI generate migration scripts for existing systems
- Keep patterns in implementation-appropriate format

**DON'T:**
- Ask AI to implement ML/AI features for the bot
- Allow configuration outside web UI
- Skip the bot pre-screening phase
- Let AI create fixed API endpoints (keep them configurable)
- Implement without audit logging
- Use specific file formats if not appropriate

### Validation Checklist for AI-Generated Code

Ask AI to verify:
- [ ] Bot only responds at 100% confidence
- [ ] Users must confirm before ticket creation
- [ ] Support mode prevents agent ticket creation
- [ ] All configuration via web UI
- [ ] Audit logging on all operations
- [ ] Proper state transitions enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or endpoints
- [ ] Patterns stored appropriately for tech stack
- [ ] No AI/ML at runtime
